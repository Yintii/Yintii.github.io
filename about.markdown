Where to begin, right? 

I have always had an affinity for computers and technology.
The moment I could, I was sitting at a computer and learning everything about it.
Eventually, I made it into a career. 

Being a developer satisfies a deep want in me to create.
I find computers and code to be the closest thing this world has to real magic.
Having a command and mastery over even a part of the craft is something I find truly intoxicating.

I was never the one for school, I much preferred doing. Cirruculum was too slow and my life was moving fast,
so I just got to work. Strategically placing myself in a position working with a web hosting provider, I was
able to start my career and pay bills. 

Over time, my skills increased, I got steady work as a developer, and I was where I wanted to be.
My struggles to learn were long in the past and I had come to a decision.
I wanted to enroll back into school. So, I did. 

Finally, pursuing a degree in computer science, I hope to be able to push my career to new heights.
I want to move on from web development eventually and work in either blockchain technologies or 
develop a new business to disrupt the payment or tax industries. I'm not sure yet I haven't 
thought that far ahead..
