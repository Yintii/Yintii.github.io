title: Building a Crypto Tax App Part 2
---

The developmnent of our product is coming along well. 
We've been refining the logic of what the MVP consists of, and we're developing a 
version of it that will be suitable for public use. The idea of the MVP was really 
just to get the concept working. Now that I know it fundamentally works, we can build upon it.

I have been working to make the whole experience as seamless as I can. The processes are all 
becoming more defined and reworked as the project develops over time. As we complete and move onto
other or new features, new needs and constraints continue to appear.

This has shaped the way the application has been reduced or expanded upon, as any new project would.
Not all of the ideas that are on paper are incoporated into the app yet, and this initially was bothering 
me. That is until I realized, it just has to be *viable*. Not complete.

The idea of 'viable' has really become more clear to me as well. Being this is my first fully fledged
application I am attempting to build a business around, I wanted to have all the ideas working 
right out of the gate, and was a little annoyed when I realized how much there was I still wanted to add.

However, I realized that's not what's important when you're developing something new and unique for the first time.
It's important that it gets built. Even if that's one layer, one component, one revision at a time. This 
realization is important I believe.

It allows you to pick up speed and velocity. You're not getting as hung up on the smaller details, but really
blocking away the major parts and taking it slowly. Consistency is what is fastest. A rush to integrate all
the parts too early was begging for trouble. 

We even started designing it a little bit.

That was my ameteur attempt at a bit of web design. I don't claim to be any good at it, but I think it looks nice.
It's certainly good enough to start building around for now.
