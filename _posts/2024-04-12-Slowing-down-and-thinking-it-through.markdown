# Lots to consider

The last 4 months has been an interesting experience. In my time developing the tax app I've come to wonder a few things.
Maybe this isn't the greatest use of my skill. Maybe I'm better suited for things that make me happier. I orginally
set out to become a developer so that I could make video games one day, so why aren't I doing that now? 
The job security I set out to look for in web development seems all but gone at this point. Nothing is really stopping me
from doing what I want to do besides myself.

I've become accustom to starting businesses, I could start my own video game company? That seems like a lot. Especially 
for someone who's only made a few small games in GameMaker. I don't see myself getting anymore work experience anytime soon
in React or in RoR honestly, and I can just apply to my Wordpress jobs in the meantime. 

There's just a massive debt the tech community seems to owe the world, and that vacuum is being filled finally. 
Tech workers stood for a long time making great salaries and driving the market. Now, seems like we're a dime a dozen. More specifically, people like me are a nickle a pound. There's tons of great developers out there without jobs. I'm 
not sure what I can do to compete with someone who has twice as much experience and work history as I do. 

I suppose any future I have in web or tech will have to come on my own terms.
