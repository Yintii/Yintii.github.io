title: The Half Year Mark
---

This has been a really interesting and fun year. I've been experimenting with lots of great ideas I've had and taking advantage of my time. This has proved to be invaluable.
What is it really that I've been doing besides not writing about the Tax app? Well, mostly looking for work, and/or money. 

## Vending Machine / Heart Vending
I've been dabbling in a very simple business this year, vending machines. I originally saw this as a venture that wouldnt be too difficult, and often saw many people online doing it as well.
I purchased my first machine from a gentleman off craigslist. 

It was a snack machine that sat in the teacher's lounge of a special needs school. He said he was looking to get rid of it
as he lived really far away and it wasn't getting as much business as it used to. The kids had opened a student store that was competeing with him. The upside was that he had no standing
contract with the school, no profit sharing set up, whatever was sold was purely mine if I wanted it. This also meant that I could move it if I wanted to, but currently already had a 
location for it and didn't immediately have to pay to have it relocated. No storage costs until I found a location because, I wasn't being forced to move it, just a clean transfer of ownership.

I had it in my mind that I could buy this older machine and install a card reader that would allow more sales from that machine. These teahcers were adults in the 21st century 
afterall,  they are more likely to have a card than cash. I was right, the machine was making money, but not as much as I had hoped. So far from the school year, I've made about $400.
Given the machine itself was $800, the card reader was $400 and the new motherboard that I had to install to ensure compatibility with the card reader was also $400, I'm still
in the hole.

## Squires Greens
Vertical Farming in the heart of San Diego. I started this with a friend as I thought it to be a bit more ambitious. I saw posts online about people growing food in their homes,
sheds, garages and anywhere else they could put a big rack. 

They were showing the math and the money around what a single rack of microgreens could yield and it was impressive. I had to look more into it and over the course of a few more
months, I decided to try it out for myself as well. Microgreens are a great way to get into farming as they are easy to grow, have a quick turnaround and are very profitable.
Fine dining often looks for fresh, bright, flavorful and colorful ingredients to garnish their dishes. Microgreens are perfect for this. Grocers are also looking for fresh produce
to sell to their customers. Microgreens are perfect for this as well. Juice and health food bars are also looking for fresh produce to add to their smoothies and salads. Microgreens fit
here too.

Many people are still not using Microgreens for their daily lives and meals, but I think that will change. There is legislation coming that will be taxing our food based on the
distance it has to travel. There is a demand for cheaper, more nutrient dense foods and there is a demand for more local produce. The closer our food is to us, the less we 
need to depend on harmful preservatives and pesticides to ensure it's freshness. 

The current stage of the business is in it's branding and product development phase. We are currently growing and selling to friends and family. We are also looking for our first customers.
We are developing busiesses brand and voice, determining how to best insert ourselves into the market. We have been looking at our competitors closely over the last 4 months, seeing exactly
how we can bring value to the market.

## KH Web Services
In my spare time I like to go to farmer's markets with my girlfriend. I was looking out for my competitors in microgreens to be honest, but I found another opportunity.
There's a lot of small, local business that are not fully taking advantage of their websites. Often, I find there websites and hosts are just taking advantage of them.
It's been a pain to have to explain to people why they don't want to use Wix, or Weebly, or any other proprietary website builder. They are often lured in with the promise of
simplicity and ease of use, but are often left with a website that is slow, unresponsive, and not very customizable. 

However this is still more attractive than hiring a developer to build a site for them. Developers are typically very expensive and are only needed occasionally. Not a lot
of people are willing to pay a $50/hour rate, and usually don't like paying a flat fee even if there's a discount to be had. 

I came to the conclusion I'd rather have these customers than allow the large corporations to continue to take my business, and their money, at both of our expense. I started to talk with
a local coffee brand and got something working. It is a relatively small brand that needs a major face lift. There is need for a custom subscription set up via the Square API and
woocommerce. I've already built a theme for them out of Blankslate and some Sass. The beautiful part is, I've not had to do much work, and I already have a basic client for $50 a month. 

As I talk to more and more intricate businesses, I will be able to price them in more appropriately. 

## The Tax App
Where the hell is this tax app.

That's a reasonable response. The answer is mostly, it's expensive and I'm poor. There's not a lot of money to be made in developing a experimental app idea that may or may not work.
Especially when you have bills to pay. The project isn't dead however, we've simply joined forces with another collegue of ours.

The Web3 space is one of the most innovative spaces there is, even if it looks like toy apps and fake money and jpgs of monkeys. We're working together with some other developers in the
space we know. They, and now we, are working to create a Web3 dashboard for a safer and more streamlined experience in Web3.

It's currently riddled with bad actors unfortunately. So much so, if you associate crypto or blockchain or NFTs with scams, I wouldn't blame you in the slightest. It's another technolgy
that is being used to scam people, but it itself is not a scam. It's just code. 

Just code that can too often drain funds from wallets, front run transactions and steal your NFTs, sandwich attacks that lay in wait for your transactions to be mined and then steal your
money. It's a mess.

People want to participate in something new however. They're often allured to blockchain for it's basic promises of decentralization, and the ability to own your own data. We want to 
provide a safer space for them to do so. 

As a part of this new tool, we will be adding the tax app. We encountered a fundamental issue with our design, and think it would be better suited to be a part of this new tool.

Our competitors in the space have already raised money to the tune of millions, and there's a lot of foundations right now willing to give money to those who build.
We're looking to take advantage of this and get some funding to build this tool. In the meantime, I've got some businesses to work on and some customers to find.
