title: The state of my career and outlook
---

This has been an interesting year all together, and really we still have so much left to go. I think I like many others are exhausted.
This was once a industry that breamed with opportunity and now even the most seasoned developers are reported 12-16 months of unemployment.
The need to pivot has arrived and a lot of people will have to leave the industry in search of paying work. Some of these individuals online
also need to consider pivoting from their career, as it seems too much of their psychological health is based on their success in an industry.

Changing from what you love to do is hard. I even see now mentors and authors of books I've read in regards to web development leave their
projects seeking employment with anyone that can pay them. They have families and greater stakes than that of I. I moved out to California
on the promise of opportunity and was a casualty of the mass layoffs. It's just me, and I only have to take care of me. This is a great
blessing in these times.

# So, no job?

This is a crazy 4 years, I have been barely surviving with freelance work, and full time positions that each continued to bleed from 
the COVID situation and sooner or later, each laid me off because of it. I am not upset about it. I'm really trying to find my footing is all.
I have a lot of interests I can explore. 

I have been looking for work, but I too have been met with what are calling the worst job market we've ever seen. Concise responses and
clear communication is not a luxury we see anymore. We are seeing more and more automation and less interest in meeting livable compensations.
I was speaking with someone who wanted to pay me $22 without benefits. Like, I can get that working in fast food these days, it's insulting. 

## What are you gonna do about it?

I don't know, but I'm sure as hell not going down in my salary or wage for this line of work. No, I would much rather return to another line
of work, and then work on developing my own company or product in my spare time. I have other businesses I have started and need to continue
in their development. Working for big tech is officially for the birds.

Yeah, I am not excited by this industry anymore. Corporations that continue to show record profits laying off people unncessarily in favor
of cheaper labour over seas. If that's who they want in their company, I love that for them. I have my own ideas, business contacts, and soft
skills that will allow me to navigate this landscape as a business developer. The only reason I've been doing any of this was to gain the
neccessary experience and knowledge to do this myself. I sure as hell never dreamt of working for an asshole when I was a kid. 

I have really put my best foot forward for all of these clients and employers and I was rewarded for my ignorance, obviously. It is time to 
take care of me and mine, and act more like a capitalist than an employee. 

### Heart Vending

This is my rock. This is the easiest plug and play little business there is. The profit on this has been slow, but after spending a bit of
time out this summer, I realized my prices are way too low. With the adjustments I should be out of the red and start profiting by the new
year. 

This was a great first business as it really taught me what to expect when starting a business. Everything is harder than it seems, and you
always need more start up capital than you think. As I took on new challenges to organize this business, it was clear I was very happy as a 
business owner. Which is what led me to start Sauires Greens.

### Squires Greens

Squires Greens is a paused venture. I am in need of extra funding and will expect some in the coming months. We have been working on 
organizational things but have not seen a lot of revenue. Once we get a new growing location, we can invest again on our brand development.

We currently have a few local chef's lined up to review our product. We have to determine a grow selection that is representative of the 
local restaurants and their current offerings. We want to then also choose a select few new greens to allow them to try with our own 
recipes and suggestions. This is to better help frame the product in their daily work and what it can offer them as a company.

### KH Web Services

This recently taught me I need contractual agreements for work no matter how regularly billed or personal the client is. At the very least a
representative website with a terms of service clearly outlined. Working with your clients directly is always a challenge if you're more 
of a introverted person, but this last client broke me. The continual arguments, the lack of communication, the blame-game, nothing was clear
and they were simplfy confused by everything. I know now how important it is to have the terms outlined and agreed to before any work is done.

### Onto new things

As I look to the future, I am going to be simplfying my time and efforts and become more focused. I will continue these businesses, and find
general work and labour for my time. I want to spend more of my personal time working on my own business, not worrying about finding a job
in another persons company. With my experience, ability, and connections, I believe me and mine can work to do something bigger than us.
